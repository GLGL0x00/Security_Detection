## Security Detection: Face, Weapon, and Criminal Recognition (Real-time)

An end-to-end system that detects weapons (guns/knives), recognizes faces, and maintains a persistent list of criminals. The system triggers alarms and captures evidence on criminal detection.

### Problem Description
Traditional CCTV lacks real-time context. This project fuses face recognition and weapon detection to: (1) flag unknown individuals holding weapons, (2) enforce per-user weapon permissions, and (3) instantly alert on known criminals with visual evidence.

### How It Works (Overview)
The pipeline combines a YOLO-based detector with LBPH face recognition, maintaining user modes and a criminals registry.

### Core Logic: Three Cases
- **Unknown person holding weapon (gun/knife)**: Add to `criminals.json` for future detection.
- **Known person with modes (allowed / not allowed)**: If not allowed and holding weapon â†’ add to criminals.
- **Criminal detected (with or without weapon)**: Play alarm and capture screenshot.

### Model Components
- **Face Recognition**: YOLO face detection + LBPH recognizer (`trainneruser.yml`).
- **Weapon Detection**: YOLO model detecting guns and knives.
- **Criminal Registry**: `criminals.json` maintained by the pipeline and `tracker.py`.

## Quick Start

### Requirements
Install Python 3.9+ and dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

### Prepare Data
- Ensure `users.json` and `trainneruser.yml` exist for known users.
- Use `create.py` to register a new user (captures 60 face images and retrains).

### Run
- Register user: `python create.py`
- Recognize / monitor users: `python detector.py`
- Criminal capture flow (screenshots + retrain): `python tracker.py`
- Weapon-only demo: `python weaponDetect.py`
- Combined live demo (faces + weapons): use `live_detection()` in `detector.py`

## Streamlit App (TODO)
- Live monitoring dashboard
- Recent detections and screenshots
- Toggle user modes (allowed/not allowed)
- Start/stop camera pipelines
